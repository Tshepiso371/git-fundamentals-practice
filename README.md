# :rocket:Conference Room Booking System

## Project Overview
The conference Room booking System is designed to help employees book conference rooms efficiently.It ensures that rooms are booked effectively by checking room availability , capacity, availability of necessary equipment and resolving booking conflicts.

The system is intended for employees , administrators , facilities managers and reception staff within an orgarnisation 

## System Context 
The system provides functionality for reserving conference rooms , applying booking constraints and managing room availability 

The project was developed through agile sprint simulation

## Repository Structure

The repository is organised to separate documentation artefacts from future
implementation work.

## Getting Started (Onboarding)

This repository is primarily focused on documentation and collaboration practices
rather than a fully implemented application.

### Prerequisites
- Git installed on your machine
- A GitHub account
- Basic understanding of Agile and Git workflows

### Setup
Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

git clone https://github.com/Tshepiso371/git-fundamentals-practice.git
cd git-fundamentals-practice

## Documentation Artefacts

This project includes several markdown artefacts created during Sprint 1 of the
Agile simulation. These documents represent the current understanding of the system
and guide future development.

- **User Stories (`user-stories.md`)**  
  Describe functional requirements from the perspective of system users.

- **Epics (`epics.md`)**  
  High-level groupings of related user stories.

- **Priority Matrix (`priority-matrix.md`)**  
  Used to assess and prioritise work based on value and effort.

- **Sprint Planning (`sprint-1-planning.md`)**  
  Defines the sprint goal, selected stories, and identified risks.

- **Daily Standups (`sprint-1-dailies.md`)**  
  Tracks daily progress, blockers, and focus areas.

- **Sprint Checkpoint (`sprint-1-checkpoint.md`)**  
  Mid-sprint assessment of progress and risk.

- **Sprint Review (`sprint-1-review.md`)**  
  Captures completed work, incomplete items, and lessons learned.

## Contribution Workflow (Pull Requests)

All changes to this repository are introduced through Pull Requests rather than
direct commits to the main branch.

The expected workflow is:
1. Create a new branch from `main`
2. Make focused, well-documented changes
3. Open a Pull Request describing:
   - Why the change is needed
   - What was changed
   - What reviewers should focus on
4. Address feedback through follow-up commits before merging

Pull Requests are used as structured communication and review artefacts, not only
as a mechanism for merging changes.

## Future Technical Documentation

The following sections will be added as the system evolves:

- Architecture overview
- API documentation
- Data models
- Validation and conflict-resolution logic
- Deployment and environment setup
