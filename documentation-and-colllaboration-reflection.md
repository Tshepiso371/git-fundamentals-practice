## Documentation and Collaboration Reflection

When I first wrote the README, I assumed that anyone reading it already understood the
project and the sprint work that had been done. Because of this, the README did not
clearly explain what the Conference Room Booking System is, who it is meant for, or how
the existing documentation should be used. A new developer joining the project would
have struggled to understand the purpose of the repository or where to begin.

The updated README now focuses on onboarding. It clearly explains the system, provides
high-level context, and describes the repository structure and sprint artefacts. By
including guidance on how to get started and how contributions should be made, the
README makes it easier for new contributors to understand the project and work
effectively from the beginning.

Working with Pull Requests during this assignment helped me understand that they are
more than just a way to merge changes. They are also a way to explain why changes are
being made and what kind of feedback is needed. This process showed me how clear
documentation and structured communication can improve collaboration and reduce
confusion, especially when working with others.
